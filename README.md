# E-Commerce-Back-End
Thirteenth week of the Sydney University coding bootcamp, this challenge consisted of developing a e-commerce back end server using express.js and sequelize. This application will use sequelize to interact with a MySQL database.

## User Story
AS A manager at an internet retail company<br>
I WANT a back end for my e-commerce website that uses the latest technologies<br>
SO THAT my company can compete with other e-commerce companies<br>

## Acceptance Criteria
GIVEN a functional Express.js API<br>
WHEN I add my database name, MySQL username, and MySQL password to an environment variable file<br>
THEN I am able to connect to a database using Sequelize<br>
WHEN I enter schema and seed commands<br>
THEN a development database is created and is seeded with test data<br>
WHEN I enter the command to invoke the application<br>
THEN my server is started and the Sequelize models are synced to the MySQL database<br>
WHEN I open API GET routes in Insomnia for categories, products, or tags<br>
THEN the data for each of these routes is displayed in a formatted JSON<br>
WHEN I test API POST, PUT, and DELETE routes in Insomnia<br>
THEN I am able to successfully create, update, and delete data in my database<br>
